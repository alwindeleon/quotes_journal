# quotes_journal
An awesome public quotes journal!

## Installing


Install NodeJS v10.13.0

Install 5.5.56-log MySQL Community Server

Configure the database configuration in config/config.js to sync with the installed databaswe

In my case, I create a quotes_journal database.

Once NodeJS is installed, go to the app's root directory and then run:

```
npm run install
```

Also install Gulp:
```
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

To run the app in development, run this in the app's directory:
```
gulp
```
